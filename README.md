this is an uncompleted project because training.npy is remaining. 
In order to obtain training.npy, first of all, save "saved_model.h5" at a different folder, then you'll run train.py and you'll obtain training.npy and after that saved_model.h5, however this saved_model.5 is not as accurated as the other one which was trained by ShrishtiHore from Github.
